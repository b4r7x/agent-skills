# Code Quality Principles

Universal quality checklist for code reviews and implementation. Framework-agnostic.

## Core Principles

### DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself

- **3+ occurrences** of the same pattern → extract into a reusable unit (function, module, type)
- **Single source of truth** — constants, types, schemas live in one place
- Shared logic belongs in a dedicated module, not copy-pasted across features
- Exception: 2 similar lines are fine. Don't extract for 2 occurrences — wait for the third.

### KISS — Keep It Simple

- Simplest solution that works. No cleverness.
- If a junior dev can't understand it in 30 seconds, simplify
- Prefer boring, obvious code over elegant abstractions
- One clear way > multiple "flexible" ways
- Direct implementation > abstraction layer > framework

### YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It

- Don't build features before they're needed
- Don't add configurability "just in case"
- Don't create helpers for one-time operations
- Start simple, refactor when the third use case appears

### SRP — Single Responsibility

- Each function does ONE thing
- Each class/module owns ONE domain
- If you need "and" to describe what it does, split it

### Less Code, Same Logic

- Remove dead code completely — no commented-out code, no `_unused` vars
- Simplify conditionals — early returns over nested if/else
- Consolidate related variables — one object or struct over 5+ separate declarations
- Inline trivial one-liners — don't create a function for `x > 0`

## Reusability Checklist

Extract into a reusable unit when ALL of these are true:

1. **3+ occurrences** — the pattern appears in 3 or more places
2. **Shared contract** — the signature/API is the same across usages
3. **Stable abstraction** — unlikely to diverge between use cases
4. **Testable** — the extracted unit can be tested independently

If any condition is false, keep the code inline.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Create a helper for a one-liner | Inline it |
| Add a config option for a hardcoded value | Just hardcode it |
| Build a factory for 2 objects | Direct instantiation |
| Create `utils.ts` with 1 function | Put it where it's used |
| Add "flexibility" before the third use case | Wait for the pattern to emerge |
| Over-abstract to "prepare for the future" | Solve today's problem |

## Code Review Questions

Before approving code, ask:

1. Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?
2. Could this be simpler without losing functionality?
3. Is anything here built "just in case"?
4. Does each function/component do exactly one thing?
5. Is there dead code that should be removed?
